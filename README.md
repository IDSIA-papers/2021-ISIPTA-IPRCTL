# 2021-ISIPTA-IPRCTL
Code and scripts used for the simulations of the paper "Robust Model Checking with Imprecise Markov Reward Models" by Alberto Termine, Alessandro Antonucci, Alessandro Facchini and Giuseppe Primiero.

The functions in [https://github.com/IDSIA-papers/2021-ISIPTA-IPRCTL/blob/main/iprctl.py](`iprctl.py`) provide tools to compute inferences in imprecise Markov chains and imprecise Markov Reward Models

These functions are used by [https://github.com/IDSIA-papers/2021-ISIPTA-IPRCTL/blob/main/experiments.py](`experiments.py`) to reproduce the experimental results and the demonstrative examples presented in the paper
