# 2021-ISIPTA-IPRCTL
Code used for the simulations of the paper "Robust Model Checking with Imprecise Markov Reward Models" by Alberto Termine, Alessandro Antonucci, Alessandro Facchini and Giuseppe Primiero.

The functions in `iprctl.py` provide tools to compute inferences in imprecise Markov chains and imprecise Markov Reward Models

These functions are used by `experiments.py` to reproduce the experimental results and the demonstrative examples presented in the paper
